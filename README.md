# Dashboard
Electricity and temperature dashboard for AI prediction.

## Introduction
In order to effectively monitor the field environment, a web dashboard was designed.

The information on the dashboard comes from the electricity and temperature and humidity data collected by the Internet of Things, which is predicted by the AI model, and then the original value and the predicted safety and alert range are transmitted to the front end for display.
